B_tree - binary search tree ( BST )

Search tree properties:
1) both subtrees - left and right - are the binary trees;

2)all nodes of the left subtree of an arbitrary node X have data key values less then  the value for the data key of the node X

3) for all nodes of the right sybtree of an arbitrary node X, the data key values are greater then oe equal to the value of the data key of the node X itself.
